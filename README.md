Second grade ITMO university Computational Maths course labs.

First lab: Made program to solve System of Linear Equasions using Gauss-Seidel method 

Second lab: Made program to sole Nonlinear equasions and system of nonlinear equasions using Newton's method and some others, used Plotters lib to make plots.

Third lab: Made program to calculate integrals using several numeric methods.

Fouth lab: Made program to approximate set of data with log, exp, power and any polynomial functions, draw plots via Plotters and choose best function.

Fifth lab: Made program to interpolate set of data using Lagrange, Newton and Gauss methods. Also draw plots via Plotters

Sixth lab: Made program to solve differential equasions.
